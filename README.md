## 🧐 Objective 
- Alzheimer's a progressive neurologic disorder that leads to shrinkage of brain and loss of cognitive abilities

- Occurs especially in people of older age  (65-80 years)

- to develop a care environment for the elderly providing basic alzheimer's care and support
<br>
<br>


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ⚒️ About The Project
- Allie is an alzheimer's focused care environment facilitating functionalities for a variety of difficulties ranging from patient safety , financial upkeep to progression tracking via features such as

- Progression Tracking :  CDT (Clock drawing test)
- Patient safety              :  Geo-fencing , ID
- Financial upkeep        :  Blockchain based Synths
- Utilities                           :  Symbl powered conversation notes 
- Well-being  : Support groups , blogs 
<br>
<br>

## 🙌🏻 Novelty of our project
* Separate platforms i.e. webapp for caregiver and app for the patient ensures ease of access, confidentiality and abstraction.

- The use of a deep learning model to analyse the Clock Drawing Test allows for periodic progression assessment and high accuracy outcomes.

- To provide financial utilities, Blockchain based synths powered by synthetix are used
 
- Use of geo-fencing as a safety feature facilitates remote safety and tracking

- Using voice analytics and  summary generated by Symbl.ai is used for personal note-keeping

- Since the webapp and application is made using flutter it is compatible with both android as well as IOS

## ✨ Future Scope
- Similar to CDT , other means of digital tests of dementia like house draw test, voice analysis test,  tile memory test can be incorporated

- Security features like Fall detection and seizure detection can be added

- We can also create alexa skills for the voice tests as well report analysis

- Medicine and tasks reminder can also be incorporated

- Instead of just synths we can also add normal crypto assets for financial utility
